# Obi WooCommerce Countries

Let's say you have a WooCommerce shop and sell to any country in the world.

Your customers need to select their country to complete the purchase.

The countries where most sales are coming from are added to the top of the countries drop down field in the checkout page, to make it easier for customers to select their country.
